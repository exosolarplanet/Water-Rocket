The aim of this project is to measure the instantaneous values for altitude, acceleration in 3-dimension and 1-dimension, temperature, pressure and vibration as the water rocket completes its flight. Additionally, these values are saved to SD card on Feather M0 and displayed on a spreadsheet.

All the detailed information regarding code is explained with comments on the code.
