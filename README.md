# Water-Rocket
In this project Adafruit Feather M0, a vibration sensor, a barometric altimeter and a 3-axis accelerometer are used in order to receive data from the flight of a water rocket. Detailed information regarding the sensors and the microcontroller is given below:

The aim of this project is to measure the instantaneous values for altitude, acceleration in 3-dimension and 1-dimension, temperature, pressure and vibration as the water rocket completes its flight. Additionally, these values are saved to the SD card on Feather M0 and displayed on a spreadsheet.
